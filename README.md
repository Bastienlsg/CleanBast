# üìÅ CleanBast - Folder cleaner üìÅ

Clean up folders with empty files

## You need:

* [A JDK](https://www.oracle.com/fr/java/technologies/downloads/), I developed it with JDK version 20.0.1

* Clone this repository

* To make the below maneuvers easier, use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), or another IDE

* In the project:

  * Install the dependencies
  * Run the "CleanBastApp" class

## Reasons for this project:

* It is important to remove empty folders from your file system for two main reasons:
  * Empty folders can make your file system disorganized and difficult to navigate.
  * When you browse your file explorer,
    the operating system has to load the folder information,
    even if it is empty, which can slow it down.

## Warning:

* For security reasons, anything involving files
  in the main disk will not work
  this is a personal project that is not intended for any
  daily use
